### Witch Trials in Europe in 1300-1850 
This interactive historical map shows the number of witch trials in Europe over 550 years. To create it, I brought the regions and localities collected by researchers based on historical sources in line with the modern regional division of Europe (NUTS-3). The map was submitted to the [MapPromptMonday](https://github.com/MapPromptMonday/MapPromptMonday) challenge ("Proportional Symbols" for May 15th, 2023).
